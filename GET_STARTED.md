## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Test on Testnet First**
   - Use Ethereum Sepolia for Price Feeds
   - Use Blast Sepolia for Entropy
   - Get test ETH from faucets (links in README)

2. **Record a Great Demo**
   - Show the complete workflow
   - Highlight innovative features
   - Explain the AI assistant
   - Keep it under 5 minutes

3. **Documentation Matters**
   - Your README is already comprehensive
   - Add screenshots to SUBMISSION.md
   - Update placeholder URLs
   - Include your contact info

4. **Stand Out**
   - Emphasize the AI-powered guidance
   - Show how both integrations work together
   - Explain the educational value
   - Highlight the clean code structure

## 🔧 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a DeepSeek API key?**
A: No! The app works in demo mode without one. But adding a key enhances the AI responses.

**Q: What network should I use?**
A: Ethereum Sepolia for Price Feeds, Blast Sepolia for Entropy. Both are pre-configured.

**Q: Where do I get test ETH?**
A: Check the faucets listed in QUICKSTART.md and README.md.

**Q: Can I add more features?**
A: Absolutely! The codebase is clean and extensible. Ask the AI chatbot for ideas!

**Q: How do I deploy this?**
